    <h1>🏫 My School Experience</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve always been an average student, but one with consistency and effort. Throughout my school years,
      I maintained an average score of above 85% up to 10th grade. In my GSEB board 10th exams, I scored an impressive 96 percentile
      and 85% overall, with remarkable scores in core subjects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>📐 Maths: 92</li>
      <li>🔬 Science: 89</li>
      <li>📚 Social Science: 92</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, the transition to 11th grade was tough. I chose the Science stream with Maths to pursue my dream, but
      I struggled and failed most exams throughout the year. Fortunately, I managed to pass the final exams.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 12th grade, I regained my focus and worked hard, ultimately scoring 85%. My subject-wise marks were:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>📐 Maths: 94</li>
      <li>🔭 Physics: 78</li>
      <li>🧪 Chemistry: 76</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I still remember — if not for a few silly MCQ mistakes in Maths, I would have scored a perfect 100/100! 🔥
